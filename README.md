# HIVCB_ProjectCode
Publically available code for anaylses performed on neuroimaging and behavioral data collected from a sample of participants stratified into four groups based on HIV serostatus and cannabis use history

Analyses on Error Awareness Task (EAT) neuroimaging data are reported in the following manuscript:

Flannery JS, Riedel MC, Salo T, Poudel R, Laird AR, Gonzalez R, Sutherland MT. (2021). HIV infection is linked with reduced error-related default mode network suppression and poorer medication management abilities. Progress in Neuro-Psychopharmacology and Biological Psychiatry, 111(110398), 1-15, doi: /10.1016/j.pnpbp.2021.110398

Scripts used to conduct subject-level and group-level processing following fmriprep are in the error_awareness_task directory. Behavioral task data is in the data/error_awareness_task/ directory.

Analyses regarding resting-state functional connectivity of insula subregions are reported in the following manuscript:

Flannery JS, Riedel MC, Salo T, Hill-Bowen LD, Poudel R, Adams AR, Laird AR, Gonzalez R, Sutherland MT. (2021). Interactive effects of HIV infection and cannabis use on insula subregion functional connectivity. Journal of Neuroimmune Pharmacology, doi: 10.1007/s11481-021-10005-8.

Scripts used to conduct subject-level and group-level processing following fmriprep for this manuscript are in the insula_rsFC directory.

Analyses assessing resting-state functional connectivity and task-based responsivity of large-scale networks are reported in the following manuscript:

Flannery JS, Riedel MC, Hill-Bowen LD, Poudel R, Bottenhorn KL, Salo T, Laird AR, Gonzalez R, Sutherland MT. (in prep). Altered large-scale brain network interactions associated with HIV infection and error processing

Scripts used to extract and assess subject-level network timeseries data following fmriprep are in the network_rsFC directory. Average extracted network data and self-report/behavioral data is in the data/network_rsFC/ directory.
